# OCA Composer

[Overlays Capture Architecture (OCA)](https://github.com/the-human-colossus-foundation/oca-spec/tree/master/docs/specification) is an international open standard for writing data schemas. Schemas are a type of documentation that describe the structure and rules for a dataset. The OCA standard is a machine-readable schema standard that is hosted by the [Human Colossus Foundation](https://humancolossus.foundation/).

[Agri-food Data Canada](https://agrifooddatacanada.ca/) at the [University of Guelph](https://www.uoguelph.ca/) has developed the OCA Composer as a tool to help researchers document their data using the OCA standard. The OCA Composer runs in a web browser and presents a graphical user interface that guides users through the process of authoring their own schemas describing their datasets.

You can learn more about schemas and see an implementation of OCA Composer live at the [Semantic Engine](https://www.semanticengine.org/).

## OCA Composer outputs

The OCA Composer is written in React and deployed to a virtual machine which serves the web app to users. The OCA Composer app takes the user inputs and generates two types of files - the OCA File and the OCA Excel Template. Both of these files can be interpreted by parsers to generate the OCA Schema Bundle which is a single JSON file that contains the contents of the schema. Currently in this implementation only the OCA Excel Template is used and parsed to generate the OCA Schema Bundle. In the future, the OCA File will be directly consumed by an OCA Repository.

## Consuming OCA Schema Bundle - Readme and Data entry Excel

The JSON schema bundle can be consumed by several tools within the ADC/OCA ecosystem.
* [OCA Readme](https://github.com/agrifooddatacanada/OCA_README) consumes the JSON schema bundle and creates a human-readable plain text schema document.
* [Data Entry Excel]() consumes the JSON schema bundle and creates an Excel sheet for data entry based on the information provided for in the schema.
