    "Experiment...Difference..original.values.": "Experiment...Difference..original.values. refers to the computation of differences between two or more sets of original data values during an experiment. These differences could be calculated for various purposes, such as comparing the impact of different treatments, interventions, or conditions on a particular variable. The differences can help highlight the effect of the experimental factors on the data.",
    "Experiment...IQR..original.values.": "Experiment...IQR..original.values. represents a statistical measure computed during an experiment. IQR stands for \"Interquartile Range,\" which is a measure of statistical dispersion. It is calculated as the difference between the third quartile (75th percentile) and the first quartile (25th percentile) of the original data points. IQR is useful for understanding the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is less sensitive to outliers than the range.",
    "Experiment...Range..original.values.": "Experiment...Range..original.values. refers to a statistical measure calculated during an experiment. It represents the range of values observed for a particular variable or feature in the dataset. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the original data points, providing insights into the spread or dispersion of the data.",
    "Feature.ID": "Feature.ID represents a unique identifier or label assigned to a specific feature or entity in a dataset. This identifier helps to distinguish and reference individual features within the dataset. Features could be various entities, variables, or characteristics being studied or analyzed."
